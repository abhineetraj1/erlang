# Erlang Basics
*	Erlang has built-in support for fault-tolerance, which allows systems to continue operating even in the face of errors or hardware failures.
*	Erlang's main strength lies in its support for concurrency, which allows multiple processes to execute simultaneously without interfering with each other.
