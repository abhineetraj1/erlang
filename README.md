# Erlang Basics
*	Erlang has built-in support for fault-tolerance, which allows systems to continue operating even in the face of errors or hardware failures.
*	Erlang's main strength lies in its support for concurrency, which allows multiple processes to execute simultaneously without interfering with each other.

| 1 | WAP to determine whether a number is odd or even in Erlang, you can use the modulo operator %. The modulo operator returns the remainder of a division operation. If a number is divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder, it is even. Otherwise, it is odd. Here's an example function that determines whether a number is odd or even | [Code](code001.erl) |
| 2 | WAP which accepts marks of five subjects in an array, and calculates and prints the percentage, highest marks, subject name, and lowest marks | [Code](code002.erl) |
| 3 | WAP which accepts a password from the user, stores the password in a file, and verifies it when the user enters it again | [Code](code003.erl) |
| 4 | WAP to create CLI Calculator | [Code](code004.erl) |
| 5 | WAP to accept grades and print percentage | [Code](code005.erl) |
| 6 | WAP to multiplication of two matrix and getting the inverse of matrix | [Code](code006.erl) |
| 7 | Web server  | [Code](code007.erl) |
